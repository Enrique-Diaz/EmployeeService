# EmployeeService

Test project of a ÂµEmployee with the following technologies;

* MySql 8.0.17 (Connector)
* JUnit 5.5.1
* Mockito 3.0.0

# Things to consider
1. Modify the path for the logger in the src/main/resources/logback.xml
2. Update the src/main/resources/application.properties to connecto to the DB (Version I used is MySql Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.11, for osx10.9 (x86_64))
3. Project has a DDL under resources which will be executed automatically upon project starts (DB need to be running) which has the instructions to DROP `tbl_Employee` if exists, recreate it and fill it with some records to test the service, if you don't want it to be executed delete the following props in HibernateConfiguration.java;
  * hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto
  * hibernate.hbm2ddl.import_files
4. Review the DDL script to corroborate you have the same table structure you have in your own table (tbl_Employee), if you plan to use a different table structure modifications must be done.
